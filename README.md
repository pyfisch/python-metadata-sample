This repository contains `METADATA`, `WHEEL` and `PKG-INFO` collected from PyPI using a script.
The files should be used to write a new parser for the currently underspecified Python Metadata format.

* The collection `pypi-2021-03` is based on the 4000 most-downloaded packages as listed in [`top-pypi-packages-365-days.json`](https://github.com/hugovk/top-pypi-packages/blob/d0cd1f7c4506babb4e7711b489e31d18229d1540/top-pypi-packages-365-days.json).
