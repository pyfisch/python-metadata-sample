        What spotDL does:
        
        1. Downloads music from YouTube as an MP3 file
        2. Applies basic metadata gathered from Spotify such as:
           - Track Name
           - Track Number
           - Album
           - Album Cover
           - Genre
           - and more!
        
        ### Announcing spotDL v3
        
        We rebuilt spotDL from scratch to be faster, simpler, and better than spotDL v2. Documentation is still a work in progress.
        
        âš  We have dropped the active development of spotDL v2 due to support and maintainability. No focused efforts will be made to resolve v2 specific issues.

        ## Usage (Instructions for v3)
        
        - To download a song, run:
        
          ```
          $ spotdl [trackUrl]
          ```
        
          ex. `spotdl https://open.spotify.com/track/0VjIjW4GlUZAMYd2vXMi3b?si=1stnMF5GSdClnIEARnJiiQ`
        
        
        - To download an album, run:
        
          ```
          $ spotdl [albumUrl]
          ```
        
          ex. `spotdl https://open.spotify.com/album/4yP0hdKOZPNshxUOjY0cZj?si=AssgQQrVTJqptFe7X92jNg`
        
        
        - To download a playlist, run:
        
          ```
          $ spotdl [playlistUrl]
          ```
        
          ex. `spotdl https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8UXBoz02kGID?si=oGd5ctlyQ0qblj_bL6WWow`
        
        
        - To search for and download a song, run, __with quotation marks__:  
          _Note: This is not accurate and often causes errors._
        
          ```
          $ spotdl '[songQuery]'
          ```
        
          ex. `spotdl 'The Weeknd - Blinding Lights'`
        
        
        - To resume a failed/incomplete download, run:
        
          ```
          $ spotdl [pathToTrackingFile]
          ```
        
          ex. `spotdl 'The Weeknd - Blinding Lights.spotdlTrackingFile'`
        
          _`.spotdlTrackingFile`s are automatically created when a download starts and deleted on completion_
        
        
        You can queue up multiple download tasks by separating the arguments with spaces:
        
        ```
        $ spotdl [songQuery1] [albumUrl] [songQuery2] ... (order does not matter)
        ```
        
        ex. `spotdl 'The Weeknd - Blinding Lights' https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8UXBoz02kGID?si=oGd5ctlyQ0qblj_bL6WWow ...`
        
        
        
        _spotDL downloads up to 4 songs in parallel, so for a faster experience, download albums and playlist, rather than tracks._
        
        ## `pipx` Isolated Environment Alternative
        
        For users who are not familiar with `pipx`, it can be used to run scripts __without__ installing the spotDL package and all the dependencies globally with pip. (Effectively skipping over the [Installation](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader#Installation) step)
        
        First, you will need to install `pipx` by running:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install --user pipx
        python3 -m pipx ensurepath
        ```
        
        Next, you can jump directly to running spotDL with:
        
        ```
        pipx run spotdl ...
        ```
        
        ## For Developers and Contributors
        
        1. Clone this repository
           ```
           $ git clone https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader.git
           $ cd spotify-downloader
           ```
        2. Setup venv (Optional)
           - Windows
             ```
             $ py -3 -m venv env
             $ .\.venv\Scripts\activate
             ```
           - Linux/macOS
             ```
             $ python3 -m venv .venv
             $ source .venv/bin/activate
             ```
        3. Install requirements
           ```
           $ pip install -e .
           ```
        
        - Use as command (no need to re-install after file changes)
          ```
          $ spotdl [ARGUMENTS]
          ```
