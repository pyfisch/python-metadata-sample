Description: 
        PVLIB Python is a community supported tool that provides a set of
        functions and classes for simulating the performance of photovoltaic
        energy systems. PVLIB Python was originally ported from the PVLIB MATLAB
        toolbox developed at Sandia National Laboratories and it implements many
        of the models and methods developed at the Labs. More information on
        Sandia Labs PV performance modeling programs can be found at
        https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/. We collaborate with the PVLIB MATLAB project,
        but operate independently of it.
        
        We need your help to make pvlib-python a great tool!
