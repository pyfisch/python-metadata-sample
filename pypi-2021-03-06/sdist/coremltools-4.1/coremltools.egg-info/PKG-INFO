        ===========
        
        `Core ML <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml>`_
        is an Apple framework that allows developers to easily integrate
        machine learning (ML) models into apps. Core ML is available on iOS, iPadOS,
        watchOS, macOS, and tvOS. Core ML introduces a public file format (.mlmodel)
        for a broad set of ML methods including deep neural networks (convolutional
        and recurrent), tree ensembles (boosted trees, random forest, decision trees),
        and generalized linear models. Core ML models can be directly integrated into
        apps within Xcode.
        
        :code:`coremltools` is a python package for creating, examining, and testing models in
        the .mlmodel format. In particular, it can be used to:
        
        - Convert trained models from popular machine learning tools into Core ML format
          (.mlmodel).
        - Write models to Core ML format with a simple API.
        - Making predictions using the Core ML framework (on select platforms) to
          verify conversion.
