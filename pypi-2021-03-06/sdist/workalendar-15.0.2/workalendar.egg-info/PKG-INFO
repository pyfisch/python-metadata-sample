Description: # Workalendar
        
        ## Overview
        
        Workalendar is a Python module that offers classes able to handle calendars, list legal / religious holidays and gives working-day-related computation functions.
        
        ## Status
        
        This library is ready for production, although we may warn eventual users: some calendars may not be up-to-date, and this library doesn't cover all the existing countries on earth (yet).
        
        If you spot any bug or wish to add a calendar, please refer to the [Contributing doc](docs/contributing.md).
        
        ## Usage sample
        
        ```python
        >>> from datetime import date
        >>> from workalendar.europe import France
        >>> cal = France()
        >>> cal.holidays(2012)
        [(datetime.date(2012, 1, 1), 'New year'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 4, 9), 'Easter Monday'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 5, 1), 'Labour Day'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 5, 8), 'Victory in Europe Day'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 5, 17), 'Ascension Day'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 5, 28), 'Whit Monday'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 7, 14), 'Bastille Day'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 8, 15), 'Assumption of Mary to Heaven'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 11, 1), "All Saints' Day"),
         (datetime.date(2012, 11, 11), 'Armistice Day'),
         (datetime.date(2012, 12, 25), 'Christmas')]
        >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 25))  # it's Christmas
        False
        >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 30))  # it's Sunday
        False
        >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 26))
        True
        >>> cal.add_working_days(date(2012, 12, 23), 5)  # 5 working days after Xmas
        datetime.date(2012, 12, 31)
        ```

        ## External dependencies
        
        **Workalendar will require you to use Python 3.6+.**
        
        Workalendar is tested on Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and on Linux (Ubuntu), Mac OS and Windows using Github actions.
        
        ### Conditional dependencies
        
        As of v15.0.0:
        
        * If you're using \*Nix and Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, the package `backports.zoneinfo` is required
        * If you're using Windows and Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, the package `tzdata` is *also* a requirement (with the `backports.zoneinfo`).
        * If you're using Python 3.9+, the stdlib `zoneinfo` package will be used.

        ## Caveats
        
        Please take note that some calendars are not 100% accurate. The most common example is the Islamic calendar, where some computed holidays are not exactly on the same official day decided by religious authorities, and this may vary country by country. Whenever it's possible, try to adjust your results with the official data provided by the adequate authorities.
