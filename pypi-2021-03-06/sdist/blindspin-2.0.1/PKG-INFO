Description: BlindSpin: Braille Spinner for Python
        =====================================
        
        Sometimes you would just like to show the user some progress,
        but a progress bar is not suitable because you donâ€™t know how much longer it would take.
        In these cases you might want to display a simple spinner using the `spinner()` function.
        
        Example usage::
        
            with blindspin.spinner():
                do_something()
                do_something_else()
        
        
        It looks like this:
