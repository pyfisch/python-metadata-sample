Description: Python Social Auth
        ==================
        
        Python Social Auth is an easy-to-setup social authentication/registration
        mechanism with support for several frameworks and auth providers.
        
        Crafted using base code from django-social-auth, it implements a common interface
        to define new authentication providers from third parties, and to bring support
        for more frameworks and ORMs.

        -------------------------------
        
        As for Dec 03 2016, this library is now deprecated, the codebase was
        split and migrated into the `python-social-auth organization`_,
        where a more organized development process is expected to take place.
        
        Details about moving towards the new setup is documented in the
        `migrating to social`_ document.
