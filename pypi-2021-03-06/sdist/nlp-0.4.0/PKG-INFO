Description: Simple check list for release from AllenNLP repo: https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/setup.py
        
        To create the package for pypi.
        
        1. Change the version in __init__.py, setup.py as well as docs/source/conf.py.
        
        2. Commit these changes with the message: "Release: VERSION"
        
        3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: "git tag VERSION -m'Adds tag VERSION for pypi' "
           Push the tag to git: git push --tags origin master
        
        4. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between
           creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).
        
           For the wheel, run: "python setup.py bdist_wheel" in the top level directory.
           (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it).
        
           For the sources, run: "python setup.py sdist"
           You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.
        
        5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:
        
           twine upload dist/* -r pypitest
           (pypi suggest using twine as other methods upload files via plaintext.)
           You may have to specify the repository url, use the following command then:
           twine upload dist/* -r pypitest --repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
        
           Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:
           pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi nlp
        
        6. Upload the final version to actual pypi:
           twine upload dist/* -r pypi
        
        7. Copy the release notes from RELEASE.md to the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.
        
        8. Update the documentation commit in .circleci/deploy.sh for the accurate documentation to be displayed
        
        9. Update README.md to redirect to correct documentation.
