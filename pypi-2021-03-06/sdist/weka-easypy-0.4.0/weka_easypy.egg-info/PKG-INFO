        # easypy
        easypy makes python even easier!
        
        Many boiler-plate patterns are reduced to simple yet richly featured constructs:
        - concurrency - running asynchronous code easily and manageably
        - resiliency - retrying or swallowing exceptions
        - synchronization - poll-and-wait for long-running process to complete
        - collections - filter and choose objects using keywords and predicates
        
        In addition, there are humanization modules that help both code and logs more user-friendly
        - represting data-size and time units
        - randomizing strings
        - coloring and structured logging
        - tokens
        
        ... And much more!
