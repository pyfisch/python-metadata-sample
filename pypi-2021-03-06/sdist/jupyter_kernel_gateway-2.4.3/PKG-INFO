Description: Jupyter Kernel Gateway is a web server that supports different mechanisms for
        spawning and communicating with Jupyter kernels, such as:
        
        * A Jupyter Notebook server-compatible HTTP API used for requesting kernels
          and talking the `Jupyter kernel protocol <https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html>`_
          with the kernels over Websockets
        * A HTTP API defined by annotated notebook cells that maps HTTP verbs and
          resources to code to execute on a kernel
        
        The server launches kernels in its local process/filesystem space. It can be
        containerized and scaled out using common technologies like
        `tmpnb <https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb>`_,
        `Cloud Foundry <https://github.com/cloudfoundry>`_, and
        `Kubernetes <http://kubernetes.io/>`_.
