Description: CLVault
       |=======
       |
       |CLVault uses Keyring to provide a command-line utility to safely store
       |and retrieve passwords.
       |
       |Install it using pip or the setup.py script::
       |
       |    $ python setup.py install
       |
       |    $ pip install clvault
       |
       |Once it's installed, you will have three scripts installed in your
       |Python scripts folder, you can use to list, store and retrieve passwords::
       |
       |    $ clvault-set blog
       |    Set your password:
       |    Set the associated username (can be blank): tarek
       |    Set a description (can be blank): My blog password
       |    Password set.
       |
       |    $ clvault-get blog
       |    The username is "tarek"
       |    The password has been copied in your clipboard
       |
       |    $ clvault-list
       |    Registered services:
       |    blog    My blog password
       |
       |
       |*clvault-set* takes a service name then prompt you for a password, and some
       |optional information about your service. The password is safely stored in
       |a keyring while the description is saved in a ``.clvault`` file in your
       |home directory. This file is created automatically the first time the command
       |is used.
       |
       |*clvault-get* copies the password for a given service in your clipboard, and
       |displays the associated user if any.
       |
       |*clvault-list* lists all registered services, with their description when
       |given.
