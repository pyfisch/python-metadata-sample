        ## Pyomo Overview
        Pyomo is a Python-based open-source software package that supports a diverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing optimization models. Pyomo can be used to define symbolic problems, create concrete problem instances, and solve these instances with standard solvers. Pyomo supports a wide range of problem types, including:
        
         -  Linear programming
         -  Quadratic programming
         -  Nonlinear programming
         -  Mixed-integer linear programming
         -  Mixed-integer quadratic programming
         -  Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
         -  Mixed-integer stochastic programming
         -  Generalized disjunctive programming
         -  Differential algebraic equations
         -  Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints
        
        Pyomo supports analysis and scripting within a full-featured programming language. Further, Pyomo has also proven an effective framework for developing high-level optimization and analysis tools.  For example, the PySP package provides generic solvers for stochastic programming. PySP leverages the fact that Pyomo's modeling objects are embedded within a full-featured high-level programming language, which allows for transparent parallelization of subproblems using Python parallel communication libraries.
