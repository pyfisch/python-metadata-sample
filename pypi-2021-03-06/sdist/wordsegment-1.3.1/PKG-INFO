Description: Python Word Segmentation
        ========================
        
        `WordSegment`_ is an Apache2 licensed module for English word
        segmentation, written in pure-Python, and based on a trillion-word corpus.
        
        Based on code from the chapter "`Natural Language Corpus Data`_" by Peter
        Norvig from the book "`Beautiful Data`_" (Segaran and Hammerbacher, 2009).
        
        Data files are derived from the `Google Web Trillion Word Corpus`_, as
        described by Thorsten Brants and Alex Franz, and `distributed`_ by the
        Linguistic Data Consortium. This module contains only a subset of that
        data. The unigram data includes only the most common 333,000 words. Similarly,
        bigram data includes only the most common 250,000 phrases. Every word and
        phrase is lowercased with punctuation removed.

        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Installing `WordSegment`_ is simple with
        `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::
        
            $ pip install wordsegment
        
        You can access documentation in the interpreter with Python's built-in help
        function::
        
            >>> import wordsegment
            >>> help(wordsegment)
        
        Tutorial
        --------
        
        In your own Python programs, you'll mostly want to use `segment` to divide a
        phrase into a list of its parts::
        
            >>> from wordsegment import load, segment
            >>> load()
            >>> segment('thisisatest')
            ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']
        
        The `load` function reads and parses the unigrams and bigrams data from
        disk. Loading the data only needs to be done once.
        
        `WordSegment`_ also provides a command-line interface for batch
        processing. This interface accepts two arguments: in-file and out-file. Lines
        from in-file are iteratively segmented, joined by a space, and written to
        out-file. Input and output default to stdin and stdout respectively. ::
        
            $ echo thisisatest | python -m wordsegment
            this is a test
        
        If you want to run `WordSegment`_ as a kind of server process then use Python's
        ``-u`` option for unbuffered output. You can also set ``PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`` in
        the environment. ::
        
            >>> import subprocess as sp
            >>> wordsegment = sp.Popen(
                    ['python', '-um', 'wordsegment'],
                    stdin=sp.PIPE, stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.STDOUT)
            >>> wordsegment.stdin.write('thisisatest\n')
            >>> wordsegment.stdout.readline()
            'this is a test\n'
            >>> wordsegment.stdin.write('workswithotherlanguages\n')
            >>> wordsegment.stdout.readline()
            'works with other languages\n'
            >>> wordsegment.stdin.close()
            >>> wordsegment.wait()  # Process exit code.
            0
        
        The maximum segmented word length is 24 characters. Neither the unigram nor
        bigram data contain words exceeding that length. The corpus also excludes
        punctuation and all letters have been lowercased. Before segmenting text,
        `clean` is called to transform the input to a canonical form::
        
            >>> from wordsegment import clean
            >>> clean('She said, "Python rocks!"')
            'shesaidpythonrocks'
            >>> segment('She said, "Python rocks!"')
            ['she', 'said', 'python', 'rocks']
        
        Sometimes its interesting to explore the unigram and bigram counts
        themselves. These are stored in Python dictionaries mapping word to count. ::
        
            >>> import wordsegment as ws
            >>> ws.load()
            >>> ws.UNIGRAMS['the']
            23135851162.0
            >>> ws.UNIGRAMS['gray']
            21424658.0
            >>> ws.UNIGRAMS['grey']
            18276942.0
        
        Above we see that the spelling `gray` is more common than the spelling `grey`.
        
        Bigrams are joined by a space::
        
            >>> import heapq
            >>> from pprint import pprint
            >>> from operator import itemgetter
            >>> pprint(heapq.nlargest(10, ws.BIGRAMS.items(), itemgetter(1)))
            [('of the', 2766332391.0),
             ('in the', 1628795324.0),
             ('to the', 1139248999.0),
             ('on the', 800328815.0),
             ('for the', 692874802.0),
             ('and the', 629726893.0),
             ('to be', 505148997.0),
             ('is a', 476718990.0),
             ('with the', 461331348.0),
             ('from the', 428303219.0)]
        
        Some bigrams begin with `<s>`. This is to indicate the start of a bigram::
        
            >>> ws.BIGRAMS['<s> where']
            15419048.0
            >>> ws.BIGRAMS['<s> what']
            11779290.0
        
        The unigrams and bigrams data is stored in the `wordsegment` directory in
        the `unigrams.txt` and `bigrams.txt` files respectively.
