Description: 
        Pytricia is a Python module to store IP prefixes in a
        patricia tree. It's based on Dave Plonka's modified patricia tree
        code, and has three things to recommend it over related modules
        (including py-radix and SubnetTree):
        
         * it's faster,
        
         * it works nicely in Python 3, and
        
         * there are a few nicer library features for manipulating the structure.
        
        See the github repo for documentation and some performance numbers: <https://github.com/jsommers/pytricia>.
