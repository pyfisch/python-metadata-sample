Description: PKCS#12 support for requests
        ============================
        
        This library adds PKCS#12 support to the Python `requests <http://python-requests.org>`__ library.
        
        It is a **clean implementation**: it uses neither monkey patching nor temporary files. Instead, it is integrated into ``requests`` as
        recommended by its authors: creating a custom ``TransportAdapter``, which provides a custom ``SSLContext``.
        
        This library is meant to be a transitional solution until this functionality is provided by ``requests`` directly. However, that will take some time. See the `corresponding issue <https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/1573>`__ for more details.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        For simple one-off requests you can use this library as a drop-in replacement for the ``requests`` library:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from requests_pkcs12 import get
        
           r = get('https://example.com/test', pkcs12_filename='clientcert.p12', pkcs12_password='correcthorsebatterystaple')
        
        If you are using `requests sessions <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/>`__, use the ``Pkcs12Adapter``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from requests import Session
           from requests_pkcs12 import Pkcs12Adapter
        
           with Session() as s:
               s.mount('https://example.com', Pkcs12Adapter(pkcs12_filename='clientcert.p12', pkcs12_password='correcthorsebatterystaple'))
               r = s.get('https://example.com/test')
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This library is available as `PyPI package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-pkcs12>`__:
        
        ::
        
           pip install requests-pkcs12
        
        Alternatively, you can retrieve the latest development version via Git:
        
        ::
        
           git clone https://github.com/m-click/requests_pkcs12
        
        Arguments
        ---------
        
        The following keyword arguments are supported:
        
        -  ``pkcs12_filename`` is a byte string or unicode string that contains the file name of the encrypted PKCS#12 certificate.
        
           -  Either this argument or ``pkcs12_data`` must be provided.
        
        -  ``pkcs12_data`` is a byte string that contains the encrypted PKCS#12 certificate data.
        
           -  Either this argument or ``pkcs12_filename`` must be provided.
        
        -  ``pkcs12_password`` is a byte string or unicode string that contains the password.
        
           -  This argument must be provided whenever ``pkcs12_filename`` or ``pkcs12_data`` is provided.
        
        If you use these parameters, donâ€™t use the built-in ``cert`` parameter of ``requests`` at the same time. However, do use the other parameters.  In particular, do use `the "verify" parameter <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification>`__ to verify the server-side certificate.
