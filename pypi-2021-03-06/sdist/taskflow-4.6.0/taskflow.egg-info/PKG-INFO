        Testing and requirements
        ------------------------
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Because this project has many optional (pluggable) parts like persistence
        backends and engines, we decided to split our requirements into two
        parts: - things that are absolutely required (you can't use the project
        without them) are put into ``requirements.txt``. The requirements
        that are required by some optional part of this project (you can use the
        project without them) are put into our ``test-requirements.txt`` file (so
        that we can still test the optional functionality works as expected). If
        you want to use the feature in question (`eventlet`_ or the worker based engine
        that uses `kombu`_ or the `sqlalchemy`_ persistence backend or jobboards which
        have an implementation built using `kazoo`_ ...), you should add
        that requirement(s) to your project or environment.
        
        Tox.ini
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Our ``tox.ini`` file describes several test environments that allow to test
        TaskFlow with different python versions and sets of requirements installed.
        Please refer to the `tox`_ documentation to understand how to make these test
        environments work for you.
        
        Developer documentation
        -----------------------
        
        We also have sphinx documentation in ``docs/source``.
