Description: 
        Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense
        vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up
        to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for
        evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers
        for Python/numpy. It is developed by Facebook AI Research.
