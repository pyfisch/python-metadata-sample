        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        The Python client for Aerospike works with Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 running on
        **64-bit** OS X 10.9+ and Linux.
        
        NOTE: Python client 5.0.0 and up MUST be used with Aerospike server 4.9 or later.
        If you see the error "-10, ‘Failed to connect’", please make sure you are using server 4.9 or later.
        
        NOTE: The following dependencies only apply to installations that build from source
        on linux, or OS X installations.
        For client>=3.8.0 and pip>=19.0 on linux platforms, can skip to "Install" section. 
        
        The client depends on:
        
        - Python devel package
        - OpenSSL
        - The Aerospike C client
        
        RedHat 6+ and CentOS 6+
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The following are dependencies for:
        
        -  RedHat Enterprise (RHEL) 6 or newer
        -  CentOS 6 or newer
        -  Related distributions which use the ``yum`` package manager
        
        ::
        
            sudo yum install python-devel
            sudo yum install openssl-devel
        
        Debian 6+ and Ubuntu 14.04+
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The following are dependencies for:
        
        - Debian 6 or newer
        - Ubuntu 14.04 or newer
        - Related distributions which use the ``apt`` package manager
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install python-dev
            sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
        
        - You may also need libz:
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
        
        OS X
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        By default OS X will be missing command line tools. On Mavericks (OS X 10.9)
        and higher those `can be installed without Xcode <http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/>`__.
        
        ::
        
            xcode-select --install # install the command line tools, if missing
        
        OpenSSL can be installed through the `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ OS X package
        manager.
        
        ::
        
            brew install openssl
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Aerospike Python Client can be installed using ``pip``:
        
        ::
        
            pip install aerospike
        
            # client >=3.8.0 will attempt a manylinux2010 wheel installation for linux distros
            # to force a pip install from source:
            pip install aerospike --no-binary :all:
        
            # to troubleshoot pip versions >= 6.0 you can
            pip install --no-cache-dir aerospike
        
            # to trouleshoot installation on OS X El-Capitan (10.11) or OS X Sierra (10.12)
            pip install --no-cache-dir --user aerospike
        
        If you run into trouble installing the client on a supported OS, you may be
        using an outdated ``pip``.
        Versions of ``pip`` older than 7.0.0 should be upgraded, as well as versions of
        ``setuptools`` older than 18.0.0.
        
        
        OS X Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Upgrading ``pip`` on OS X El-Capitan (10.11) or OS X Sierra(10.12)
        runs into `SIP issues <https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/209572/how-to-use-pip-after-the-el-capitan-max-os-x-upgrade>`__
        with ``pip install --user aerospike`` as the recommended workaround to install aerospike on those versions of OS X.
        
        Attempting to install the client with pip for the system default Python may cause permissions issues when copying necessary files. In order to avoid
        those issues the client can be installed for the current user only with the command: ``pip install --user aerospike``
        
        If the version of Python is not in the officially supported list, or the ``--install-option`` argument is provided, pip will attempt to compile the client from source. Please see the `build directions in the GitHub repository <https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/blob/master/BUILD.md>`__
        to troubleshoot any issues caused by compiling the client.
        
        
        Build
        -----
        
        For instructions on manually building the Python client, please refer to the
        ``BUILD.md`` file in this repo.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Documentation is hosted at `aerospike-python-client.readthedocs.io <https://aerospike-python-client.readthedocs.io/>`__
        and at `aerospike.com/apidocs/python <http://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/python/>`__.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Example applications are provided in the `examples directory of the GitHub repository <https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/tree/master/examples/client>`__
        
        For examples, to run the ``kvs.py``:
        
        ::
        
            python examples/client/kvs.py
        
        
        Benchmarks
        ----------
        
        To run the benchmarks the python module 'tabulate' need to be installed. In order to display heap information the module `guppy` must be installed.
        Note that `guppy` is only available for Python2. If `guppy` is not installed the benchmarks will still be runnable.
        Benchmark applications are provided in the `benchmarks directory of the GitHub repository <https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/tree/master/benchmarks>`__
        
        By default the benchmarks will try to connect to a server located at 127.0.0.1:3000 , instructions on changing that setting and other command line flags may be displayed by appending the `--help` argument to the benchmark script. For example:
        ::
        
            python benchmarks/keygen.py --help
