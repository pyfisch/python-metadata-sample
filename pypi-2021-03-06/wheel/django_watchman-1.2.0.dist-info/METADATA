Testimonials
------------

    We're in love with django-watchman. External monitoring is a vital part of our service offering. Using django-watchman we can introspect the infrastructure of an application via a secure URL. It's very well written and easy to extend. We've recommended it to many of our clients already.

â€” Hany Fahim, CEO, `VM Farms <https://vmfarms.com/>`_.

Quickstart
----------

1. Install ``django-watchman``::

    pip install django-watchman

2. Add ``watchman`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'watchman',
    )

3. Include the watchman URLconf in your project ``urls.py`` like this::

    re_path(r'^watchman/', include('watchman.urls')),

4. Start the development server and visit ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/watchman/`` to
   get a JSON response of your backing service statuses::

    {
        "databases": [
            {
                "default": {
                    "ok": true
                }
            }
        ],
        "caches": [
            {
                "default": {
                    "ok": true
                }
            }
        ],
        "storage": {"ok": true}
    }

Features
--------

Human-friendly dashboard
************************

Visit ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/watchman/dashboard/`` to get a human-friendly HTML
representation of all of your watchman checks.

Token based authentication
**************************

If you want to protect the status endpoint, you can use the ``WATCHMAN_TOKENS`` setting.
This is a comma-separated list of tokens.
When this setting is added, you must pass one of the tokens in as the ``watchman-token`` **GET** parameter::

    GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/watchman/?watchman-token=:token

Or by setting the ``Authorization: WATCHMAN-TOKEN`` header on the request::

    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: WATCHMAN-TOKEN Token=\":token\"" http://127.0.0.1:8000/watchman/

If you want to change the token name, you can set the ``WATCHMAN_TOKEN_NAME``.
The value of this setting will be the **GET** parameter that you must pass in::

    WATCHMAN_TOKEN_NAME = 'custom-token-name'

    GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/watchman/?custom-token-name=:token

**DEPRECATION WARNING**: ``WATCHMAN_TOKEN`` was replaced by the ``WATCHMAN_TOKENS`` setting to support multiple authentication tokens in django-watchman ``0.11``.
It will continue to work until it's removed in django-watchman ``1.0``.

Custom authentication/authorization
***********************************

If you want to protect the status endpoint with a customized
authentication/authorization decorator, you can add ``WATCHMAN_AUTH_DECORATOR``
to your settings. This needs to be a dotted-path to a decorator, and defaults
to ``watchman.decorators.token_required``::

    WATCHMAN_AUTH_DECORATOR = 'django.contrib.admin.views.decorators.staff_member_required'

Note that the ``token_required`` decorator does not protect a view unless
``WATCHMAN_TOKENS`` is set in settings.

Custom checks
*************

django-watchman allows you to customize the checks which are run by modifying
the ``WATCHMAN_CHECKS`` setting. In ``settings.py``::

    WATCHMAN_CHECKS = (
        'module.path.to.callable',
        'another.module.path.to.callable',
    )

You can also import the watchman.constants to include the DEFAULT_CHECKS and PAID_CHECKS in your ``settings.py``::

   from watchman import constants as watchman_constants

   WATCHMAN_CHECKS = watchman_constants.DEFAULT_CHECKS + ('module.path.to.callable', )


Checks take no arguments, and must return a ``dict`` whose keys are applied to the JSON response. Use the ``watchman.decorators.check`` decorator to capture exceptions::

    from watchman.decorators import check

    @check
    def my_check():
        return {'x': 1}

In the absence of any checks, a 404 is thrown, which is then handled by the
``json_view`` decorator.

Run a subset of available checks
********************************

A subset of checks may be run, by passing ``?check=module.path.to.callable&check=...``
in the request URL. Only the callables given in the querystring which are also
in ``WATCHMAN_CHECKS`` should be run, eg::

    curl -XGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/watchman/?check=watchman.checks.caches

Skip specific checks
********************

You can skip any number of checks, by passing ``?skip=module.path.to.callable&skip=...``
in the request URL. Only the checks in ``WATCHMAN_CHECKS`` which are not in the
querystring should be run, eg::

    curl -XGET http://127.0.0.1:8080/watchman/?skip=watchman.checks.email

Check a subset of databases or caches
*************************************

If your application has a large number of databases or caches configured,
watchman may open too many connections as it checks each database or cache.

You can set the ``WATCHMAN_DATABASES`` or ``WATCHMAN_CACHES`` settings in order
to override the default set of databases and caches to be monitored.

Ping
****

If you want to simply check that your application is running and able to handle
requests, you can call ping:

    GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/watchman/ping/

It will return the text ``pong`` with a 200 status code. Calling this doesn't
run any of the checks.

Bare status view
****************

If you would like a "bare" status view (one that doesn't report any details,
just ``HTTP 200`` if checks pass, and ``HTTP 500`` if any checks fail), you
can use the ``bare_status`` view by putting the following into ``urls.py``::

    import watchman.views
    # ...
    re_path(r'^status/?$', watchman.views.bare_status),

Django management command
*************************

You can also run your checks without starting the webserver and making requests.
This can be useful for testing your configuration before enabling a server,
checking configuration on worker servers, etc. Run the management command like so::

    python manage.py watchman

By default, successful checks will not print any output. If all checks pass
successfully, the exit code will be ``0``. If a check fails, the exit code will
be ``1``, and the error message including stack trace will be printed to ``stderr``.

If you'd like to see output for successful checks as well, set verbosity to
``2`` or higher::

    python manage.py watchman -v 2
    {"storage": {"ok": true}}
    {"caches": [{"default": {"ok": true}}]}
    {"databases": [{"default": {"ok": true}}]}

If you'd like to run a subset of checks, use ``-c`` and a comma-separated list
of python module paths::

    python manage.py watchman -c watchman.checks.caches,watchman.checks.databases -v 2
    {"caches": [{"default": {"ok": true}}]}
    {"databases": [{"default": {"ok": true}}]}

If you'd like to skip certain checks, use ``-s`` and a comma-separated list of
python module paths::

    python manage.py watchman -s watchman.checks.caches,watchman.checks.databases -v 2
    {"storage": {"ok": true}}

Use ``-h`` to see a full list of options::

    python manage.py watchman -h

X-Watchman-Version response header
**********************************

Watchman can return the version of watchman which is running to help you keep
track of whether or not your sites are using an up-to-date version. This is
disabled by default to prevent any unintended information leakage for websites
without authentication. To enable, update the ``EXPOSE_WATCHMAN_VERSION``
setting::

    EXPOSE_WATCHMAN_VERSION = True

Custom response code
********************

By default, watchman will return a ``500`` HTTP response code, even if there's a
failing check. You can specify a different response code for failing checks
using the ``WATCHMAN_ERROR_CODE`` setting::

    WATCHMAN_ERROR_CODE = 200

Logging
*******

watchman includes log messages using a logger called ``watchman``.
You can configure this by configuring the ``LOGGING`` section of your Django
settings file.

Here is a simple example that would log to the console::

    LOGGING = {
        'version': 1,
        'disable_existing_loggers': False,
        'handlers': {
            'console': {
                'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
            },
        },
        'loggers': {
            'watchman': {
                'handlers': ['console'],
                'level': 'DEBUG',
            },
        },
    }

More information is available in the `Django documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/logging/#configuring-logging]>`_.

APM (Datadog, New Relic)
************************

If you're using APM and watchman is being often hit for health checks (such as an ELB on
AWS), you will find some stats based on averages will be affected (average transaction
time, apdex, etc):

You can disable APM instrumentation for watchman by using the ``WATCHMAN_DISABLE_APM``
setting::

    WATCHMAN_DISABLE_APM = True

This currently supports the following agents:

* Datadog
* New Relic

Please open an issue if there's another APM you use which is being affected.


Available checks
----------------

caches
******

For each cache in ``django.conf.settings.CACHES``:

* Set a test cache item
* Get test item
* Delete test item

databases
*********

For each database in ``django.conf.settings.DATABASES``:

* Verify connection by calling ``connections[database].introspection.table_names()``

email
*****

Send a test email to ``to@example.com`` using ``django.core.mail.send_mail``.

If you're using a 3rd party mail provider, this check could end up costing you
money, depending how aggressive you are with your monitoring. For this reason,
this check is **not enabled** by default.

For reference, if you were using Mandrill, and hitting your watchman endpoint
once per minute, this would cost you ~$5.60/month.

**Custom Settings**

* ``WATCHMAN_EMAIL_SENDER`` (default: ``watchman@example.com``): Specify an email to be the sender of the test email
* ``WATCHMAN_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`` (default: ``[to@example.com]``): Specify a list of email addresses to send the test email
* ``WATCHMAN_EMAIL_HEADERS`` (default: ``{}``): Specify a dict of custom headers to be added to the test email

storage
*******

Using ``django.core.files.storage.default_storage``:

* Write a test file
* Check the test file's size
* Read the test file's contents
* Delete the test file

By default the test file gets written on the root of the django ``MEDIA_ROOT``. If for whatever reasons this path is not writable by the user that runs the application you can override it by setting ``WATCHMAN_STORAGE_PATH`` to a specific path.
Remember that this must be within the ``MEDIA_ROOT``, which by default is your project root. In ``settings.py``::

  WATCHMAN_STORAGE_PATH = "/path_to_your_app/foo/bar/"

If the ``MEDIA_ROOT`` is already defined::

  from os.path import join as joinpath
  WATCHMAN_STORAGE_PATH = joinpath(MEDIA_ROOT, "foo/bar")

Default checks
**************

By default, django-watchman will run checks against your databases
(``watchman.checks.databases``), caches (``watchman.checks.caches``), and
storage (``watchman.checks.storage``).

Paid checks
***********

Currently there is only one "paid" check - ``watchman.checks.email``. You can
enable it by setting the ``WATCHMAN_ENABLE_PAID_CHECKS`` to ``True``, or by
overriding the ``WATCHMAN_CHECKS`` setting.
