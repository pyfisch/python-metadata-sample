# easypy
easypy makes python even easier!

Many boiler-plate patterns are reduced to simple yet richly featured constructs:
- concurrency - running asynchronous code easily and manageably
- resiliency - retrying or swallowing exceptions
- synchronization - poll-and-wait for long-running process to complete
- collections - filter and choose objects using keywords and predicates

In addition, there are humanization modules that help both code and logs more user-friendly
- represting data-size and time units
- randomizing strings
- coloring and structured logging
- tokens

... And much more!
