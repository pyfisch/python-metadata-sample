Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB) is an efficient cross-platform
similarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of similarity search methods. 
The goal of the project is to create an effective and comprehensive toolkit for searching 
in generic and non-metric spaces. Even though the library contains a variety of metric-space 
access methods, our main focus is on generic and approximate search methods, in particular, 
on methods for non-metric spaces. NMSLIB is possibly the first library with a principled 
support for non-metric space searching.
