mirakuru
========

Mirakuru is a process orchestration tool designed for functional and integration tests.

Maybe you want to be able to start a database before you start your program
or maybe you just need to set additional services up for your tests.
This is where you should consider using **mirakuru** to add superpowers to your program or tests.

About
-----

In a project that relies on multiple processes there might be a need to guard code
with tests that verify interprocess communication. So one needs to set up all of
required databases, auxiliary and application services to verify their cooperation.
Synchronising (or orchestrating) test procedure with tested processes might be a hell.

If so, then **mirakuru** is what you need.

``Mirakuru`` starts your process and waits for the clear indication that it's running.
Library provides seven executors to fit different cases:

* **SimpleExecutor** - starts a process and does not wait for anything.
  It is useful to stop or kill a process and its subprocesses.
  Base class for all the rest of executors.
* **Executor** - base class for executors verifying if a process has started.
* **OutputExecutor** - waits for a specified output to be printed by a process.
* **TCPExecutor** - waits for the ability to connect through TCP with a process.
* **UnixSocketExecutor** - waits for the ability to connect through Unix socket
  with a process
* **HTTPExecutor** - waits for a successful HEAD request (and TCP before).
* **PidExecutor** - waits for a specified .pid file to exist.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import HTTPExecutor
    from httplib import HTTPConnection, OK


    def test_it_works():
        # The ``./http_server`` here launches some HTTP server on the 6543 port,
        # but naturally it is not immediate and takes a non-deterministic time:
        executor = HTTPExecutor("./http_server", url="http://127.0.0.1:6543/")

        # Start the server and wait for it to run (blocking):
        executor.start()
        # Here the server should be running!
        conn = HTTPConnection("127.0.0.1", 6543)
        conn.request("GET", "/")
        assert conn.getresponse().status is OK
        executor.stop()


A command by which executor spawns a process can be defined by either string or list.

.. code-block:: python

    # command as string
    TCPExecutor('python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025', host='localhost', port=1025)
    # command as list
    TCPExecutor(
        ['python', '-m', 'smtpd', '-n', '-c', 'DebuggingServer', 'localhost:1025'],
        host='localhost', port=1025
    )

CHANGELOG
=========

2.3.0
----------

- [enhancement] Ability to set up expected exit code for executor. In Java exit codes 1- 127 have 
  special meaning, and the regular exit codes are offset by those of special meaning.

2.2.0
----------

- [enhancement] If process is being closed and the shutdown won't be clean (won't return exit code 0)
  mirakuru will now rise ProcessFinishedWithError exception with exit_code

2.1.2
----------

- [bugfix][macos] Fixed typing issue on macOS

2.1.1
----------

- [bug] Always close connection for HTTPExecutor after_start_check
- [enhancement] Log debug message if execption occured during
  HTTPExecutor start check
- [ehnancement] adjust typing handling in HTTPExecutor

2.1.0
----------

- [feature] Drop support for python 3.5. Rely on typing syntax and fstrings that
  is available since python 3.6 only
- [ehnancement] For output executor on MacOs fallback to `select.select` for OutputExecutor.
  Increases compatibility with MacOS where presence of `select.poll` depends
  on the compiler used.
- [enhancement] Apply shelx.quote on command parts if command is given as a list
  Should result in similar results when running such command with or without shell.

2.0.1
----------

- [repackage] - mark python 3.5 as required. Should disallow installing on python 2

2.0.0
----------

- [feature] Add UnixSocketExecutor for executors that communicate with Unix Sockets
- [feature] Mirakuru is now fully type hinted
- [feature] Drop support for python 2
- [feature] Allow for configuring process outputs to pipe to
- [feature] OutputExecutor can now check for banner in stderr
- [feature] HTTPEecutor now can check status on different method.
  Along with properly configured payload and headers.
- [feature] Ability to set custom env vars for orchestrated process
- [feature] Ability to set custom cwd path for orchestrated process
- [enhancement] psutil is no longer required on cygwin

1.1.0
----------

- [enhancement] Executor's timeout to be set for both executor's start and stop
- [enhancement] It's no longer possible to hang indefinitely on the start
  or stop. Timeout is set to 3600 seconds by default, with values possible
  between `0` and `sys.maxsize` with the latter still bit longer
  than `2924712086` centuries.

1.0.0
----------

- [enhancement] Do not fail if processes child throw EPERM error
  during clean up phase
- [enhancement] Run subprocesses in shell by default on Windows
- [ehnancement] Do not pass preexec_fn on windows

0.9.0
----------

- [enhancement] Fallback to kill through SIGTERM on Windows,
  since SIGKILL is not available
- [enhancement] detect cases where during stop process already exited,
  and simply clean up afterwards

0.8.3
----------

- [enhancement] when killing the process ignore OsError with errno `no such process` as the process have already died.
- [enhancement] small context manager code cleanup


0.8.2
----------

- [bugfix] atexit cleanup_subprocesses() function now reimports needed functions


0.8.1
----------

- [bugfix] Handle IOErrors from psutil (#112)
- [bugfix] Pass global vars to atexit cleanup_subprocesses function (#111)


0.8.0
----------

- [feature] Kill all running mirakuru subprocesses on python exit.
- [enhancement] Prefer psutil library (>=4.0.0) over calling 'ps xe' command to find leaked subprocesses.


0.7.0
----------

- [feature] HTTPExecutor enriched with the 'status' argument.
  It allows to define which HTTP status code(s) signify that a HTTP server is running.
- [feature] Changed executor methods to return itself to allow method chaining.
- [feature] Context Manager to return Executor instance, allows creating Executor instance on the fly.
- [style] Migrated `%` string formating to `format()`.
- [style] Explicitly numbered replacement fields in string.
- [docs] Added documentation for timeouts.

0.6.1
----------

- [refactoring] Moved source to src directory.
- [fix, feature] Python 3.5 fixes.
- [fix] Docstring changes for updated pep257.

0.6.0
----------

- [fix] Modify MANIFEST to prune tests folder.
- [feature] HTTPExecutor will now set the default 80 if not present in a URL.

0.5.0
----------

- [style] Corrected code to conform with W503, D210 and E402 linters errors as reported by pylama `6.3.1`.
- [feature] Introduced a hack that kills all subprocesses of executor process.

- [tests] increased tests coverage.
  Even test cover 100% of code it doesn't mean they cover 100% of use cases!
- [code quality] Increased Pylint code evaluation.

0.3.0
-------

- [feature] Introduced PidExecutor that waits for specified file to be created.
- [feature] Provided PyPy compatibility.
