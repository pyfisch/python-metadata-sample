# NimbusML

`nimbusml` is a Python module that provides Python bindings for [ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning). 

`nimbusml` aims to enable data science teams that are more familiar with Python
to take advantage of ML.NET's functionality and performance. It provides
battle-tested, state-of-the-art ML algorithms, transforms, and components. The
components are authored by the team members, as well as numerous contributors
from MSR, CISL, Bing, and other teams at Microsoft.

`nimbusml` is interoperable with `scikit-learn` estimators and transforms,
while adding a suite of fast, highly optimized, and scalable algorithms written
in C++ and C\#. `nimbusml` trainers and transforms support the following data
structures for the `fit()` and `transform()` methods:

-   `numpy.ndarray`
-   `scipy.sparse_cst`
-   `pandas.DataFrame`.

In addition, `nimbusml` also supports streaming from files without loading the
dataset into memory with `FileDataStream`, which allows training on data
significantly exceeding memory.

With `FileDataStream`, `nimbusml` is able to handle up to a **billion**
features and **billions** of training examples for select algorithms.

For more details, please refer to the documentation:
