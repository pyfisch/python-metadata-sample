pyroma
======

Pyroma rhymes with aroma, and is a product aimed at giving a rating of how well
a Python project complies with the best practices of the Python packaging
ecosystem, primarily PyPI, pip, Distribute etc, as well as a list of issues that
could be improved.

The aim of this is both to help people make a project that is nice and usable,
but also to improve the quality of Python third-party software, making it easier
and more enjoyable to use the vast array of available modules for Python.

It's written so that there are a library with methods to call from Python, as
well as a script, also called pyroma.

It can be run on a project directory before making a release:

    $ pyroma .

On a distribution before uploading it to the CheeseShop:

    $ pyroma pyroma-1.0.tar.gz

Or you can give it a package name on CheeseShop:

    $ pyroma pyroma

Giving it a name on CheeseShop is the most extensive test, as it will
test for several things isn't otherwise tested.

In all cases the output is similar::

    ------------------------------
    Checking .
    Found pyroma
    ------------------------------
    The packages long_description is quite short.
    ------------------------------
    Final rating: 9/10
    Cottage Cheese
    ------------------------------

Tests
-----

This is the list of checks that are currently performed:

* The package should have a name, a version and a Description.
  If it does not, it will receive a rating of 0.

* The version number should be a string. A floating point number will
  work with distutils, but most other tools will fail.

* The version number should comply to PEP386.

* The description should be over 10 characters, and the long_description
  should be over a 100 characters.

* Pyroma will convert your long_description to HTML using Docutils, to
  verify that it is possible. This guarantees pretty formatting of your
  description on PyPI. As long as Docutils can convert it, this passes,
  even if there are warnings or error in the conversion. These warnings
  and errors are printed to stdout so you will see them.

  NB! Currently this doesn't change the rating, this is because Docutils
  no longer raises an error during this process, so I have to rewrite the
  test. Once it's reinstated, incorrect syntax will be fatal.

* You should have the following meta data fields filled in:
  classifiers, keywords, author, author_email, url and license.

* You should have classifiers specifying the supported Python versions.

* You should have a classifier specifying the project license.

* If you are checking on a PyPI package, and not a local directory or
  local package, pyroma will check the number of owners the package has
  on PyPI. It should be three or more, to minimize the "Bus factor",
  the risk of the index owners suddenly going off-line for whatever reason.

* If you are checking on a PyPI package, and not a local directory or
  local package, pyroma will check that you have uploaded a source
  distribution, and not just binary distributions.

  [ericof, 4383, regebro]


2.3 (2017-11-28)
----------------

- Check that a classifier specifies the project license. [4383]

- Dropped support for Python 2.6, 3.3 and 3.4.

- Fixed a unicode issue [gotcha]

- Stopped recommending places to keep documentation.


2.2 (2016-10-26)
----------------

- Removed the TestSuite rating. I decided it was too close to looking at
  code quality. Pyroma no longer cares if you have tests or not.

- Fixed #36: PyPI now requires https.


2.1 (2016-10-18)
----------------

- #35: Support for PEP-440.


2.0.2 (2016-03-06)
------------------

  in the setup.py.


2.0.1 (2016-03-06)
------------------

- Fixed a bug under Python 3 with certain imports.


2.0.0 (2016-02-28)
------------------

- Stable release.


2.0.0b2 (2015-11-09)
--------------------

- Made it run under Python 3 again.

- PEP8


2.0.0b1 (2015-11-08)
--------------------

- Big rewrite of how data is extracted from Distutils/Setuptools.


1.8.3 (2015-11-08)
------------------

- Issue #26: Checking a PyPI package could fail under Python 3.

1.8.2 (2015-06-14)
------------------

- Do not complain that the version number should be a string, when it
  is a basestring.
  [maurits]


1.8.1 (2015-04-27)
------------------

- This is what happens when you don't run the tests after merging.


1.8 (2015-04-27)
----------------

- More robust rating. [Jeff Quast]

- Closed #24.


1.7 (2014-10-19)
----------------

- Package name lookup is now case insensitive. [Dmitry Vakhrushev]

- Fixed yet another error in return value. [Dmitry Vakhrushev]


1.6 (2014-04-17)
----------------

- Fixed issue #17: Integration with zest.releaser stopped working.

- Fixed issue #18: Pyroma returns the rating as an exit code, this was a
  mistake. It now returns 0 on success, 1 on incorrect options and 2 if
  the rating is below 8.

- Fixed issue #19: Implementing a custom test class counts as having tests.

- 8: Philadelphia is now considered a "success" based on practical experience.


1.5 (2013-10-18)
----------------

- Fixed issue #13: Pyroma would fail if there was no description.

- Dropping support for Python 3.1. It still works, but it is unsupported.

- Added support for command line options, implementing #14 and #15.


1.4 (2013-05-29)
----------------

- Issue #13: Pyroma would fail when checking a package name if no source
  distribution could be found.

- Added a check that the package has a source distribution on PyPI.


1.3.1 (2013-05-29)
------------------

- Issue #11: pyroma would fail if long_description was a non-string.

- zest.releaser now only runs Pyroma on Python packages.

- Because packages that use external test-runners can not get more
  that 9/10, this value is now also seen as acceptable when running
  Pyroma through zest.releaser.


1.3 (2013-03-15)
----------------

- Added a test to make sure the version number is a string.

- Made sure errors were printed also when a fatal error was encountered.

- Better log messages.

- The zest.releaser hook is now done before tagging, as it's more useful there.
  Especially in conjunction with check-manifest.

- Having no long_description no longer causes pyroma to fail.


1.2 (2013-03-06)
----------------

- Removed the running of tests. I always found it a bit iffy, and getting
  rid of it solved a lot of issues. Pyroma is now focused solely on
  packaging quality.

- A package on PyPI with several versions will no longer return an error.

- Now looks for documentation on pythonhosted.org or readthedocs.org.

- Adds a hook for zest.releaser, so it can be run after doing the checkout,
  before uploading to PyPI.


1.1 (2013-03-05)
----------------

- Better handling if there is no package data, for example if setup.py doesn't
  call setup() unless you run it as the "__main__" script.

- If setup.py doesn't call setup() look for a main() script and try to run it.


1.0 (2013-03-05)
----------------

- Support for Python 3.3

- Added test for PEP 386 compliance.


0.9.3 (2011-03-17)
------------------

- It's now using a ProxyStub for the PyPI xmlrpclib during tests.

- Removed the Dependency rating.

- Added a rating that runs tests, to see if they run. This will also take
  care of checking for dependencies.


0.9.2 (2011-03-13)
------------------

- Commented out the dependency test, it was too unreliable.

- Fixed the ReST.

- Python 3 support.


0.9.1 (2011-03-08)
------------------

- Initial release
