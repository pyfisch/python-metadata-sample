This is the official Mixpanel Python library. This library allows for
server-side integration of Mixpanel.

`mixpanel_api package`_.


Installation
------------

The library can be installed using pip::

    pip install mixpanel


Getting Started
---------------

Typical usage usually looks like this::

    from mixpanel import Mixpanel

    mp = Mixpanel(YOUR_TOKEN)

    # tracks an event with certain properties
    mp.track(DISTINCT_ID, 'button clicked', {'color' : 'blue', 'size': 'large'})

    # sends an update to a user profile
    mp.people_set(DISTINCT_ID, {'$first_name' : 'Ilya', 'favorite pizza': 'margherita'})

You can use an instance of the Mixpanel class for sending all of your events
and people updates.
